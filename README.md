***Introducing GulMohar: Empowering Positive Change through Green Events and Rewards!***

GulMohar is an innovative event organizing platform designed to encourage and promote environment-friendly initiatives. With a focus on sustainability, the platform aims to bring individuals, communities, and organizations together to actively participate in events that foster a greener world. Through GulMohar, users can take part in a variety of impactful activities such as cleaning drives, recycling programs, street education campaigns, tree plantations, water conservation efforts, and animal care initiatives.

## How It Works:

- Event Registration: Users interested in attending an environment-friendly event can browse through the list of upcoming activities on the GulMohar platform. After selecting an event that suits their preferences, they register for it through the app.

- QR Code Generation: Upon successful registration, the GulMohar app generates a unique QR code for each participant. This QR code serves as the user's digital identity for the specific event they have registered for.

- Event Attendance: On the day of the event, participants physically attend the gathering organized by the event host. This could be a cleanup drive, a tree plantation event, a recycling program, or any other environmentally conscious initiative.

- QR Code Scanning: The event organizer, equipped with a QR code scanner, will be responsible for recording attendance. As each participant arrives, the organizer scans their unique QR code using the GulMohar app's built-in scanner.

- Token Transfer: After the QR code is scanned, the GulMohar app initiates an instant transfer of the corresponding Mohars to the participant's digital wallet. The transaction is recorded on the Solana blockchain, ensuring transparency, security, and integrity of the token transfer process.

- Earning Mohars: The number of Mohars earned by each participant is directly linked to their level of involvement and contribution during the event. Active participation and dedicated efforts are rewarded with a higher number of Mohars, encouraging individuals to make a meaningful impact during the event.

- Real-Time Updates: Participants can check their Mohar balance in real-time within the GulMohar app or any crypto wallet. This feature enables users to stay informed about their current earnings and the total Mohars they have accumulated over time.

## The problem GulMohar solves

Gulmohar, the innovative web app powered by Solana, revolutionizes the way people contribute to saving the planet. With Gulmohar, users can engage in a wide range of impactful tasks and make a real difference while earning smart tokens.

Environmental Restoration: Plant trees, clean up beaches, restore ecosystems, and participate in various environmental restoration projects to combat climate change and protect biodiversity.

Community Initiatives: Join hands with local communities to support sustainable practices, organize clean-up drives, promote recycling, and spread awareness about eco-friendly living.

Wildlife Conservation: Contribute to the protection and conservation of endangered species, participate in wildlife monitoring programs, and support initiatives that safeguard natural habitats.

Green Technologies: Explore and promote the adoption of green technologies, such as renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and eco-friendly practices in industries, contributing to a cleaner and greener future.

Climate Advocacy: Get involved in advocacy campaigns, sign petitions, and raise awareness about pressing climate issues to drive policy changes and shape a more sustainable future.

Gulmohar not only makes it easier for individuals to actively participate in these noble endeavors but also ensures that their efforts are rewarded. By utilizing Mohars which are smart tokens built on Solana, volunteers can earn valuable rewards that can be redeemed for various benefits, such as discounts on eco-friendly products, access to exclusive events, or even funding for their own sustainability projects.

Challenges we ran into

## Some of the challenges we ran into while building this project are:
Smart Contract Development: Creating smart contracts on the Solana blockchain can be complex, especially if the project involves intricate tokenomics or complex functionalities. Developers may encounter challenges in writing and deploying smart contracts securely and efficiently. To overcome this, they can leverage existing frameworks, libraries, and development tools specific to Solana, like Solana SDK or Solana Program Library (SPL), to streamline the development process and ensure code reliability.

Scalability and Performance: Building a web app that interacts with the blockchain requires considerations for scalability and performance. Handling a large number of transactions, ensuring low-latency response times, and optimizing the app's infrastructure are crucial. Developers can address this challenge by implementing efficient data structures, employing caching mechanisms, and leveraging Solana's high throughput and low transaction costs to deliver a seamless user experience.

Security and Auditing: With any web app handling financial transactions and user data, security is paramount. Developers must be vigilant against potential security vulnerabilities, such as smart contract exploits, transaction malleability, or data breaches. Regular security audits, code reviews, and adherence to best practices, such as secure coding standards and thorough testing, can help mitigate risks and ensure the app's robustness.

## Conclusion:

GulMohar serves as a groundbreaking platform that harnesses the power of blockchain technology to drive positive change in our environment. By creating an ecosystem where green initiatives are rewarded, users are not only motivated to actively participate in events but also empowered to make a tangible difference. With GulMohar, we believe that a brighter, greener future is within reach as we unite people under a shared mission of sustainable living and collective responsibility towards the planet. Together, we can sow the seeds of change and cultivate a world filled with hope and growth, much like the vibrant and beautiful GulMohar tree.
